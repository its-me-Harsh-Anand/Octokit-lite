## Unfork

Delete repositories easily with Unfork.

<details><summary>Idea behind Unfork</summary>

GitHub forks tend to be created for the following reasons:
1. Following tutorials ðŸ“–
2. Contributing to open source projects (especially during [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)!) ðŸ’»
3. GitHub automatically forking stuff for you when you just wanted to view the source code for a particular file of a project ðŸ˜†

After months and years, usually these forks still stay in your repository â€” and that's because of how _inconvenient_ it is to identify and delete the many forks that you have made.

Unfork helps you to solve that problem **easily** âœ¨
